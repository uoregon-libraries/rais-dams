RAIS DAMS
===

This project is a very simple and mostly worthless prototype that was used to
showcase RAIS running on a Raspberry Pi 3B+.  Don't use this for anything real.
Its purpose is to scan a filesystem for images and present an interface into
the filesystem to let users see JP2s served up by RAIS and presented in a
simple OpenSeadragon view.

That's all the explanation you will get.  Look at the source if you really want
details.  Things are very hard-coded and we don't expect to maintain this
project.
